  <h1>Privacy Policy for Discord Utility | Universe</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> March 6, 2025</p>
  
  <p>Welcome to the Privacy Policy for Discord Utility | Universe, a Chrome extension developed by Universe Utilities Team. This policy explains how we handle your data when you use our extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Discord Utility | Universe does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The extension:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accesses Discord URLs (e.g., `https://discord.com/*`) solely to open minimal chat popups based on the active tab.</li>
    <li>Uses Chrome's local storage to save user-defined bookmarks for Discord channels, which is stored locally on your device and not shared with us or third parties.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No personal data (e.g., names, emails, or messages) is gathered or processed by this extension.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>The extension uses the accessed Discord URLs and local storage data only to provide its core functionalityâ€”displaying a minimal chat interface and managing bookmarks. We do not use this information for advertising, analytics, or any other purpose.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties. All processing occurs locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect the local data stored by the extension. However, no method of data storage is 100% secure, and you use the extension at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@universeutils.com">support@universeutils.com</a>. This is a generic support email, and no personal information will be requested.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This extension is provided "as is" for private use by invited individuals only. By using it, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
